# sqrt
Testing the efficiency of integer square root algorithms

## TODO
* Evaluate the performance of the digit-by-digit approximation method with various inputs.
* Compare the computational efficiency between the lookup table square root algorithm and the digit-by-digit approximation method.
* Assess the memory overhead of the lookup table square root algorithm.
